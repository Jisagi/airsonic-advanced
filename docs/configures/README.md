# Configures

Airsonic-Advanced has a number of configuration options.
You can configure the default options using `Java options` and `environment variables` on the first launch. 
Additionally, you can modify options by editing the configuration file `airsonic.properties` or through the `web interface`.

Some settings can only be changed by Java options. These settings are not modifiable through the web interface and the airsonic.properties file.
Please see the [Configure Airsonic using standalone](#configure-airsonic-using-standalone) and [Configure Airsonic using tomcat](#configure-airsonic-using-tomcat) sections for more details.
